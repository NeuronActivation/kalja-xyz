## 🤝 Contributing

🃏 **Card Suggestions**  
Created a card that should come with a breathalyzer? Create an [issue](https://github.com/NeuronActivation/kalja-xyz/issues/new?template=card-suggestion.yml) - we'll drink to that idea! 🍻

🤓 **Code Contributions**  
Our cocktail recipe for clean code:
1. 🍹 **Shake well** - Run `pnpm format`
2. 📜 **Leave instructions** - TSDoc comments so we remember it tomorrow
3. 🧪 *Optional garnish* - Tests (like olives in a martini)


**Pro Tip:** All PRs are code-reviewed with a drink in hand 🥃 - the tipsier the review, the more creative the feedback!

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
