## ü§ù Contributing

üÉè **Card Suggestions**  
Created a card that should come with a breathalyzer? Create an [issue](https://github.com/NeuronActivation/kalja-xyz/issues/new?template=card-suggestion.yml) - we'll drink to that idea! üçª

ü§ì **Code Contributions**  
Our cocktail recipe for clean code:
1. üçπ **Shake well** - Run `deno fmt`
2. üìú **Leave instructions** - TSDoc comments so we remember it tomorrow
3. üß™ **Optional garnish** - Tests, with vitest (like olives in a martini)


**Pro Tip:** All PRs are code-reviewed with a drink in hand ü•É - the tipsier the review, the more creative the feedback!

## üôè Acknowledgments
üçª **Original Inspiration**  
This project owes its existence to:
[**Juomapeli-App**](https://github.com/Santerhy/Juomapeli-App) - The Finnish drinking game pioneer

> *"Good artists copy, great artists get inspired and then accidentally create something completely different"*
